% all_results_expected contains all runs, at all threshold levels, with multiple values of K_init
% thresholded_results contains all runs, at only 'optimal' threshold level, with multiple values of K_init
% restricted_results contains all runs, at only 'optimal' threshold level, with only 'optimal' value of K_init
% 'optimal' refers to the value chosen to be most suitable for analysis, see the paper for further details
%   on how this was chosen
% All these dataframes contain rows for any runs that failed, these have the 'run_complete' variable set to False
%   These correspond to runs that crashed, failed to complete within the time limit, ran out of memory or returned 0 factors
%   They roughly correspond to rows with recovered_K either NA or 0.
